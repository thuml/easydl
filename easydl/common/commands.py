    Usage:
        runTask [-h] <file> [--maxGPU=<int>] [--needGPU=<int>] [--maxLoad=<float>] [--maxMemory=<float>] [--sleeptime=<seconds>] --user=<string>

    Options:
      -h, --help     Show this screen.
      <file>            file that contains one task per line (should end with & to be run background)
      --maxGPU=<int>       maximum GPU to use by one user [default: 100].
      --needGPU=<int>     number of GPUs per task/line [default: 1].
      --maxLoad=<float>     GPU with load larger than this will be regarded as not available [default: 0.1].
      --maxMemory=<float>    GPU with memory usage larger than this will be regarded as not available [default: 0.1].
      --sleeptime=<seconds>    sleep time after executing one task/line [default: 180.0].
      --user=<string>           query how many GPUs user used so that it does not violatethe limitation of maxGPU per user


    this is a command. After install the package, the command will be available.

    this command is designed to run tasks automatically.

    suppose that one has 10 tasks to run but only has 8 GPUs, each task requires 1 GPU.  He has to
    run 8 tasks first, then checks whether tasks finish frequently, which is annoying.

    with this commoand ``runTask``, one can specify 10 commands to run in a file. every ``sleeptime`` seconds, it checks
    whether ``needGPU`` GPUs are available. if there are enough GPUs to run on, it get one line from ``file`` and executes
    the line. (if it succeeds in executing the line, that line will be removed.)

    the ``user`` argument is needed to query how many GPUs are in use (together with ``maxGPU``, it limits the number of
    GPUs one can use. This is often the case when GPUs are shared and one can't take up all GPUs)
